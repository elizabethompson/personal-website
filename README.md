=============================

## Disclaimer

I have redesigned my website and this code no longer represents the working code for [elizabeththompson.me](http://elizabeththompson.me).

## Discovery

Representing both the owner and client relieves some of the frustrations from this process. The basic requirements are: 

1. Landing page which catches interest
2. About page to describe myself and different roles
3. Portfolio gallery displaying my latest work
4. Contact Form
4. Links to social media accounts

## Design

1. Tools: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator

## Development

I kept it simple...for now.

1. Markup: HTML, CSS 
2. Script: jQuery, PHP
2. APIs: Behance API and Google Font API
